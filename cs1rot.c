/* encryption scheme - called ROT 13.5. In this encryption scheme whenever you encrypt a vowel (a, e, i, o, u) as plain text,
the next encrypted letter moves to the next letter 14 times in the latin alphabet. In all other cases a plain
text letter will be moved to the next letter 13 times. This means that the word “hello” becomes “urzyb”
under rot 13.5. */
