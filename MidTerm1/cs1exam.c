/* 
Dynamic memory (how to use malloc, calloc, realloc and free), stdlib.h
null (free? idk)

Array lists (initalize, add/append, how to double when expanding), 

Strings (strcpy,strcmp,strcat,strlen, 
            =   -       +=
null terminator and pointer, 
destination, source (copycat)
(copy cat has risk of overflow)
strn 
strings.h


Analysis (big oh best, worse, average case )
suppose for array the size of 100 with big o(n^2) takes 30 ms, 
if I have another array that takes 270ms than what's the array size? 
//it's 300

Recursion (reduce problem to simpler identical subproblem, Hanoi,
base case / recursive case), 

Log search (binary, ternary and when to use them),
binary -> target, ternary search (extremes, max, min )

Sorts (quick, merge, selection, insertion, bubble)
merge, quick, recurisive (O(nlogn))
the rest O(n^2)

one formula sheet written, front and back anything you want (8.5" x 11" (at most))
BRING PENS and ID and no calculator  

Format is 5-8 easy questions, 3 hard (choose 2)
